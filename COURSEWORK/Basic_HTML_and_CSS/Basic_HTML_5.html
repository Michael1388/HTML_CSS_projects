			<p>This is what the css stylesheet as it relates to paragraphs does to this page.</p>
		
		
			<p>HTML Entities are used to replace charachters that are reserved charachters in HTML.<br>
			There are Entity names and numbers but browser support is better for numbers than for names. 
			<br>
			As an example, using a greater than or less than sign, because of HTML's syntax, may confuse a browser and what was intended may not display correctly. 
			Therefore the less than sign can be replaced by the Entity name "& lt" or Entity Number "& #60".
			Each name or number is preceeded by & for instance &entity_name or &entity_number with no space as seen previously 
			in the less than symbol example. There is no space between the & and the name or number code, added here for clarity.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>We have also added a text-shadow property into our css file and it displays the shadow as seen above in the title.</p>
