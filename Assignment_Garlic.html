			<p>Here is a quote from the <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/can-dogs-eat-garlic/">AKC's</a> website:</p>

Can dogs eat garlic?

The answer, emphatically, is no.

Is It Safe for Dogs to Eat Garlic?
Garlic might be good for people, but dogs metabolize certain foods differently than we do. According to the Merck Veterinary Manual, garlic and other members of the allium family, including onions, contain thiosulfate, which is toxic to dogs but not to humans.</blockquote>
